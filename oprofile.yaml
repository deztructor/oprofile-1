Description: |
    OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of
    profiling all running code at low overhead. OProfile is released under
    the GNU GPL.
    
    It consists of a kernel module and a daemon for collecting sample data,
    and several post-profiling tools for turning data into information.
    
    OProfile leverages the CPU hardware performance counters to enable
    profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which can also
    be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled: hardware
    and software interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel, shared
    libraries, and applications (the only exception being the oprofile
    interrupt handler itself).
    
    OProfile is currently in alpha status; however it has proven stable
    over a large number of differing configurations. As always, there is no
    warranty.
    
    This is the package containing the userspace tools.
